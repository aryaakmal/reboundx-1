 * Authors                 D. Tamayo
 * Implementation Paper    
 * Based on                https://reboundx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/add_effect.html
 * C Example               :ref:`c_example_stark_force`
 * Python Example          `CentralForce.ipynb <https://github.com/dtamayo/reboundx/blob/master/ipython_examples/CentralForce.ipynb>`_.

 * 
 * Adds a constant stark  acceleration.
 * Effect is turned on by adding Acentral and gammacentral parameters to a particle, which will act as the central body for the effect,
 * and will act on all other particles.
 *
 * **Effect Parameters**
 * 
 * None
 *
 * **Particle Parameters**
 *
 * ============================ =========== ==================================================================
 * Field (C type)               Required    Description
 * ============================ =========== ==================================================================
 * Acentral (double)             Yes         Normalization for central acceleration.
 * gammacentral (double)         Yes         Power index for central acceleration.
